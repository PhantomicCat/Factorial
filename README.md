# What is Factorial?
This is very simple file reader. Right now Factorial can't read each file, but right now Factorial cannot read all formats, but over time it is planned to expand the functionality of reading files.

## About Preview
Factorial doesn't have all the features it should have. Also, this program may contain a huge number of bugs and shortcomings that will be corrected over time.

## Which formats can read Factorial
Most likely only text files

## This program just for fun
"Factorial" was created with the goal of improving my programming skills, so this program is created just for fun.

## Build warning

Preview builds are extremely unstable, so be prepared for anything!!
